# `binary-assets`

This is a companion to the [REPL](https://github.com/world-class/REPL). Because we want to keep the REPL as light as a feather so it's easier to work with, binary files will be stored here, whatever they are\*. This will include:

- Images;
- PDFs;
- DOC / DOCX;
- Executables and scripts (Python, Bash, etc.).

\* :exclamation: **Exception:** Class notes (from students, professors and other sources) are stored in the dedicated [world-class/notes](https://github.com/world-class/notes) repository.
